# DynamicSDTimer

## Getting Started
### Prequisites
All you need to run this app is `docker`, which can be obtained from [here](hub.docker.com).
### Usage
Start the app by running `./build.sh`. To see Socket.io in action, open [localhost:8999](http://localhost:8999) across multiple tabs, or expose the port to your local network using a program like `ngrok` for cross-device testing.
